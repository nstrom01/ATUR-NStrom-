# ATUR Project - Individual Contributions 
### Nathan Strom 

### Overview
For the ATUR project, I am investigating how various features of the vadose zone influence the potential for groundwater recharge from surface water. I am specifically assessing how configurations of various vadose features may result in recharge potential of lack there of. The specific vadose zone features I am assessing are related to soil type, plant cover, evpotranspiration patterns, combined with intervals of surface flux through various precipitation patterns. 

The purpose of this project is to gain a window into the vadose zone and it's mechanics that determine if recharge will occur. In many models and approaches assessing recharge, the vadose zone and it's complicated mechanics can be often overlooked or oversimplifed. This project aims to assess in what specific configurations of landscape can the vadose zone be simplifed, and in what arrangements may models miss certain influences on recharge mechanics because it is being oversimplifed. 

### Methods Being Used
For this project, phydrus, a python library that implements the HYDRUS-1D unsaturated zone model developed by Šimůnek, J., M. Th. van Genuchten, and M. Šejna.
